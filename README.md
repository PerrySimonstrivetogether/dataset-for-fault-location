# dataset-for-fault-location
This dataset is simulated through Matlab/Simulink and can be used for fault location in IEEE 33-test system
It has 9 variables record:voltage for three phase(U),voltage angle for three phase(T), and current (I) for three phase. Since in some GNN-based fault location literature, the authors demonstrated that U, T is the most important, thus we only use them for our experiment. 
Since github only allows files less than 25MB to be upload, so you can save the dataset through the link below:
