# dataset-for-fault-location
This dataset is simulated through Matlab/Simulink and can be used for fault location in IEEE 33-test system
It has 9 variables record:voltage for three phase(U),voltage angle for three phase(T), and current (I) for three phase. Since in some GNN-based fault location literature, the authors demonstrated that U, T is the most important, thus we only use them for our experiment.
